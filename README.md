# PyBamm_FastCycling
This explores the use of PyBamm to build degradation models of NMC811 under different cycling rates.

After reading the paper by (O'Kane et al., 2022) this is an exploration of the effect that slow and fast charge has on the key degradation mechanisms outlined in the paper:
- SEI
- Particle Fracture (represented by SEI on cracks)
- Lithium plating
